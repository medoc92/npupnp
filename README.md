npupnp (new pupnp or not pupnp ?) is an UPnP library derived from the
venerable pupnp (https://github.com/pupnp/pupnp), based on its 1.6.x
branch (around 1.6.25).

Main modifications:

 - Use libcurl for HTTP client functions.
 - Use libmicrohttpd for HTTP server functions (GENA SOAP and Webserver).
 - Use C++ STL as needed to eliminate local-grown data structures as
   needed.

The changes reduce the library from around 40000 lines of code to around
20000, replacing difficult to maintain (and sometimes weird) code with well
supported and maintained libraries.

For now, npupnp still relies on, but does not bundle, the XML DOM ixml
library, which is built and installed with pupnp.

The C API has been fully preserved, and, at this point, you just need to
change the include directory and library name to switch between pupnp and
npupnp.
