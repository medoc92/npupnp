npupnp (new pupnp or not pupnp ?) is an UPnP library derived from the
venerable pupnp (https://github.com/pupnp/pupnp), based on its 1.6.x
branch (around 1.6.25).

Main modifications:

 - Use libcurl for HTTP client functions.
 - Use libmicrohttpd for HTTP server functions (GENA SOAP and Webserver).
 - Use C++ STL as needed to eliminate local-grown data structures as
   needed.

The changes reduce the library from around 40000 lines of code to around
20000, replacing difficult to maintain (and sometimes weird) code with well
supported and maintained libraries.

The C API has been almost fully preserved, except for a few calls which
passed IXML DOM tree objects as parameters, where they have been replaced
by either XML string documents or C++ STL structures.
